 ### Problem solving is the meta-skill.

 dont waste your time and do the best way to solve problems by:
  -  having a framework 
  -  practicing it.

### what should you do when you encounter a new problem?
1. Understand :
Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them 
2. Plan : Plan your solution
To get a good plan, answer this question:
    “Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”
3. Divide : break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
Then, solve each sub-problem one by one.<br>
4. Stuck?<br>
 if I’m stuck and can’t even solve a sub-problem, dont wory its happens to everyone!<br>
 ### Three things to try when facing a whammy
 - Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. 
 - Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. 
 - Research: No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it.
__Practice__<br>
 If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!
__Conclusion__<br>
problem-solving is an incredible skill to cultivate (the meta-skill).

## Solve Programming Problems

### simple set of steps
- Read the problem completely twice.
- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
- Optimize the manual steps.
- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
- Optimize the real code.

## 5 Whys Analysis
### use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.

The model follows a very simple seven-step process:
 1. Assemble a Team
 2. Define the Problem
 3. Ask the First "Why?"
 4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
 5. Know When to Stop
 6. Address the Root Cause(s)
