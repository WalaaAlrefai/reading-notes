Data Structures and Algorithms
RECURSION:
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.
Data Structure :
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

BIG O:

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. It is a member of a family of notations invented by Paul Bachmann, Edmund Landau, and others, collectively called Bachmann–Landau notation or asymptotic notation.

8 commonly used data structures every programmer must know:

1. Arrays
An array is a structure of fixed-size, which can hold items of the same data type.

2. Linked Lists
linked list is a sequential structure that consists of a sequence of items in linear order which are linked to each other.

3. Stacks
A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out — the element placed at last can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages.

4. Queues
A queue is a FIFO (First In First Out — the element placed at first can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages.

5. Hash Tables
A Hash Table is a data structure that stores values which have keys associated with each of them.

6. Trees
A tree is a hierarchical structure where data is organized hierarchically and are linked together.

7. Heaps
A Heap is a special case of a binary tree where the parent nodes are compared to their children with their values and are arranged accordingly.

8. Graphs
A graph consists of a finite set of vertices or nodes and a set of edges connecting these vertices.

Discussion Questions:
Q1. the choice of data structure depends on the specific problem's requirements, including the types of operations involved, efficiency considerations, memory constraints, access patterns, and concurrency requirements. Analyzing these factors will help you select the most suitable data structure for your problem.
Q2. To avoid infinite recursive call stack:
Define a base case to stop the recursion.
Ensure each recursive call progresses towards the base case.
Consider limiting recursion depth or utilizing tail recursion optimization for efficiency.
