## Pain and Suffering

### describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python?

the pain of growth,is the most challenging faced by beginners, most times it won’t feel good.

### strategies for overcoming these obstacles
 - seek the remedy! Ask questions that bridge the gap between what you know and what you need to be able to do. Research! 
 - Don’t experience the pain in silence—that slides toward needless pain and the realm of suffering.
 - Find the common thread that makes the pain worthwhile, that puts the pain into perspective.

 ## Guide to Big O

 ### concept of time complexity and space complexity.

__Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.__

__The Time Complexity__ of an algorithm/code is not equal to the actual time required to execute a particular code, but the number of times a statement executes.

__The space Complexity__ of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. 

## Names and Values in Python

### Difference between mutable and immutable in python

__mutable__ it means that we can change their content without changing their identity, like Lists and Dictionaries.

__immutable__  don’t allow this change. You’ll just have the option of creating new objects of the same type with different values.
