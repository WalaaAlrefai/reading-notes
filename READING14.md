## Matplotlib:

 - Matplotlib is a versatile library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
 - It provides a low-level interface and allows fine-grained control over the appearance of the plots.
 - Matplotlib is a good choice for creating basic plots, such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, etc.
- Example: Creating a line plot to visualize the trend of a time series data.
## Seaborn:

 - Seaborn is a higher-level library built on top of Matplotlib that simplifies the process of creating attractive statistical visualizations.
 - It provides a wide range of built-in themes and color palettes to enhance the aesthetics of the plots.
 - Seaborn is particularly useful for statistical data exploration and visualization.
 - Example: Creating a box plot to compare the distribution of a variable across different categories.
## Bokeh:

 - Bokeh is a library for creating interactive visualizations that are suitable for web browsers.
 - It focuses on producing interactive and interactive-ready visualizations for web-based applications.
 - Bokeh allows the creation of interactive plots, dashboards, and applications with features like zooming, panning, and tooltips.
 - Example: Creating an interactive scatter plot with tooltips 
 
 __to explore the relationship between two variables.
In Seaborn, the main functions to create different types of plots are:__

### 1. Relational plots:

 - Functions like scatterplot(), lineplot(), and relplot() are used to create 
relational plots.
 - Relational plots show the relationship between two variables and are often used to explore correlations and patterns.
 - Example use case: Creating a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the sepal length and width in the Iris dataset.
### 2. Categorical plots:

 - Functions like barplot(), boxplot(), violinplot(), and countplot() are used to create categorical plots.
 - Categorical plots are used to display the distribution of categorical variables or to compare different categories.
 - Example use case: Creating a bar plot to compare the average sales of different products in a store.
### 3. Distribution plots:

 - Functions like histplot(), kdeplot(), and distplot() are used to create distribution plots.
 - Distribution plots show the distribution of a single variable or the comparison between distributions.
 - Example use case: Creating a histogram to visualize the distribution of student test scores.
